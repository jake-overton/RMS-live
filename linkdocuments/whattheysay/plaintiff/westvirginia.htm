<h1>West Virginia</h1>
<hr class="main-hr">


<p>I recently had the privilege of conducting a mediation with the services of
  Mr. Strauss.&nbsp; Mr. Strauss' experience and knowledge in the area of nursing
  home litigation was a benefit to all involved.&nbsp; I was pleased with his
  ability to objectively analyze both sides of our case.&nbsp; It is clear that
  without Mr. Strauss' help and services as mediator we would not have been able
  to settle this case. </p>

<p>This was my first mediation with Mr. Strauss who was suggested as a mediator
  by defense counsel.&nbsp; Even though this was my first experience with Mr. Strauss,
  I feel confident that should I need his services in the future, I will not hesitate
  to contact him. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding Mr. Strauss' ability and effectiveness as a
  mediator, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
