<hr class="main-hr">
	<p>I had the pleasure of working with Richard Strauss as a mediator in two
		matters recently and I want to provide this letter as a letter of recommendation.
		&nbsp; Richard's expertise, professionalism and dedication are second-to-none.
		&nbsp; He works with all parties to see if he can get a fair and just resolution
		to put matters behind all parties and to heal.&nbsp; Richard's techniques and
		mannerisms lend greatly to his success.</p>

	<p>I recommend him highly.</p>
