	<h1>Wisconsin</h1>
	<hr class="main-hr">
	<p>I recently had an opportunity to work with Richard Strauss in the
		resolution of a complex nursing home case.&nbsp; Richard's extensive
		background in the nursing home field certainly gave him an advantage in
		understanding and analyzing the medical, clinical and legal issues in our
		case.&nbsp; He had a thorough understanding of the facts and the parties'
		positions before the mediation started. Throughout the day, it was clear
		that he had the trust of both parties.&nbsp; He made helpful suggestions at
		appropriate points to move the parties to resolution.&nbsp; My client, the
		facility, was very satisfied with the outcome.</p>
